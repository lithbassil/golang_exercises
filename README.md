# Go Language Exercises
This repository contains a collection of exercises for learning and practicing Go programming language. 
Each exercise is designed to test your understanding of a particular concept in Go, and comes with a set of test cases that you can run to check your solutions.

The exercises are organized into different directories based on their difficulty level, with each directory containing a README file that explains the exercise and its requirements. Some exercises may require you to implement a function, while others may require you to write a complete program.

To get started, clone this repository and choose an exercise directory that matches your skill level. Read the README file carefully, and then start coding! You can run the test cases using the go test command, which will report any errors or failures.

We hope you enjoy these exercises, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvements. Happy coding!
